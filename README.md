# RosselMix

This app is a news application heavily inspired by LeSoir app by Rosssel group.
This is only used for training in android dev with compose and not intended to be published on Google play or any other app store (Rossel do not sue me pls).


# The App

The app has 4 part "La une" which cxontains news divided in categories like sport and politics. the data is collected by the public LeSoir rss files.
Another news part is "Le fil info" which is sim√πply the latest news obtained by getting news from all rss them sorting by date.
Both sections can display the article within a WebView in the app. There is also a bookmark mechanism with a local Room database and a dedicated section. 
Finally the last section is for reading the newspaper itself as a pdf. for this one I took the pdfs from metro newspaper also from Rossel henceforth the mix.
